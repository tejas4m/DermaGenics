## Abstract

For the past few years, skin cancer has been considered one of the most dangerous types of cancer for humans. Skin cancer is found in many types, including melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma, of which melanoma is the most unpredictable. Detecting cancer of early-stage melanoma can help cure it. Computer vision can play an important role in medical imaging and  has been proven by many existing systems. 
In this project, we'll use machine learning and technology tools to calculate how to detect melanoma skin cancer. The input to the system is a skin lesion image, which is analyzed using new image processing techniques to infer the presence of skin cancer. 
Lesion image analysis tools examine the presence of melanoma (a type of skin cancer) through image segmentation and feature-stage texture, size, and shape analysis. The extracted feature parameters are used to classify the image as a cancerous lesion of normal skin and melanoma. So, DermaGenics is a web application integrated with the Deep Learning model that helps users to upload a picture of the spot and our model will process it and determine whether the spot is malignant or benign.
