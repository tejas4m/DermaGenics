## Abstract
Skin cancer has become one of the most serious kinds of cancer for people in recent years. Melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma are all kinds of skin cancer, with melanoma being the most unexpected. Melanoma can be cured if detected in its early stages. Computer vision can be useful in medical imaging and has already been shown in a number of systems. This study calculates how to identify melanoma skin cancer using machine learning and technological tools. A skin lesion image is sent into the system, which is then examined using novel image processing algorithms to infer the existence of skin cancer. By segmenting the picture and assessing the texture, size, and form of the tumour, the lesion image analysis tool checks for the existence of melanoma (a kind of skin cancer). The picture is classified as a malignant lesion of normal skin or melanoma using the derived feature characteristics. In a nutshell, DermaGenics is a web application integrated with the YOLOv5 model that allows users to input stain's photos. The model takes care of it and evaluates if the stain is cancerous or benign.
